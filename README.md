SwimWatch
*************************************************
Swim Watch is made with the  intention to create an interval trainer that will allow for a coach to run a practice and have multiple instances of intervals
for swimmers with varying levels of expierience. This program hopes to make practices more efficiant and to take the thinking out of practice so athletes.
can focus more on their stroke mechanics and mentality of their sport.
***************************************************

Currently this program is just in the logic phase. Current TODO's are listed and layout continues to be worked on as I am a novice programmer
